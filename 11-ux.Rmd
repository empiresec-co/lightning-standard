selling points must be, ease of use, free, strong community and support.

It must be possible to enable BTC payments with the click of ONE button. They need to be paid out in fiat (pay out in sats can be enabled)

(Almost) everything needs to be abstracted away. All obstacles need to be removed.

It must be FOSS, paid support for bigger companies is possible (see Zabbix).

It must fulfill all regulatory and legal requirements of most countries which is a fucking pain in the ass.

There must be excellent community support including from technicians and tax consultants.

If someone can pull this off, Bitcoinâ€™s wide adoption will experience an acceleration never seen before.

Normies will experience first hand that Bitcoin works and people use it.
They will see magic happen. 

Price will 100x
